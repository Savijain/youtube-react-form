# About the form

In this project, I have included a form with different batch details available. It stores user's Full name, Age, Mobile number, Email ID, Batch and Payment Status.

# About the API

This API is developed using C# .NET framework. It includes GET, POST, UPDATE, DELETE method.
For backend, database is created in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
Database: CustomerDB
Table Name: Registration

#Issues faced
1. Being new to react js, I faced difficulties in:
   #Developing the form, 
   #Understanding and making connection between form and API.
   #Developing 'CompletePayment' Method
   
   
   #Assumption: If the value entered in Payment Amount field is 500, return Payment Successful
                else, return Payment Unsuccessful
